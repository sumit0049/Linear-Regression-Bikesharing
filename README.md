## General Information
- This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

## Technologies Used
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- statsmodels


## Conclusions
- Company should focus on expanding business during Spring.
- Company should focus on expanding business during September.
- Based on previous data it is expected to have a boom in number of users once situation comes back to normal, compared to 2019.
- There would be less bookings during Light Snow or Rain, they could probably use this time to serive the bikes without having business impact.
- Hence when the situation comes back to normal, the company should come up with new offers during spring when the weather is pleasant and also advertise a little for September as this is when business would be at its best.
